🔹 1️⃣ #### **Search Campaign (Manual Setup – High Intent First)**
- I started with Manual CPC, kept the campaign mobile-only, and fixed ad timing from 10 AM – 5 PM (peak enquiry hours).
- Only Phrase + Exact match keywords were used.

👉 Why this approach:
- In the early stage, I wanted full control over where traffic comes from, instead of letting Google push traffic randomly. This kept intent high and search term data clean.

🔹 2️⃣ #### **Automated Rule (Bid Protection Logic)** ⚙️
- I added an automated rule to increase bids by 20% whenever Top IS Lost (Rank) crossed 5%, scheduled to run daily at 1:30 PM.

👉 Why this matters:
- This keeps ads in strong positions without manually checking performance again and again.
- Automation here supports strategy — it doesn’t override control.

🔹 3️⃣ #### **A/B Experiment (Let Data Decide)** 🧪
Created a 50/50 split experiment between:
• Manual CPC
• Maximize Clicks

👉 Why I did this:
- Instead of guessing which bidding strategy might work, I let real performance numbers decide.

🔹 4️⃣ #### **Display Campaign (Clean & Controlled Setup)**
Display was handled very carefully:
– Built a custom audience
– Set a fixed ₹5 CPC
– Turned Optimized Targeting OFF
– Removed all mobile app placements
– Reduced desktop bids by 50%

👉 Reasoning:
- Display campaigns can burn budget very fast, so I locked it down to keep traffic relevant and efficient.

🔹 5️⃣ #### **Dynamic Search Ads (DSA – Long-Tail Capture)**
- Added DSA to capture extra long-tail searches directly from the landing page.

👉 Why DSA helps:
- It helps discover high-intent queries you wouldn’t normally add manually.

🔹 6️⃣ #### **Performance Max (Complete Inputs, Not Half Setup)**
For P Max, I ensured a fully filled setup:
– Uploaded all assets (images, videos, headlines)
– Added clear search themes
– Selected Target CPA
– Cleaned up conversion tracking

👉 Key Learning:
- P Max works best when you feed it completely, not partially.

🔹 7️⃣ #### **UTM Tracking Setup (Measurement Done Right)** 📊
- To avoid guessing where leads were coming from, I implemented custom UTM tracking at campaign level.

- I tracked:
– Source (Google Ads)
– Medium (Paid)
– Campaign name
– Ad group & creative details
– Device, keyword & placement data

- All URLs were tested before going live, and tracking columns were enabled inside Google Ads for clear visibility.
👉 Why this matters:
- UTM tracking shows which campaign, keyword, device and ad actually drives leads — not just clicks.
